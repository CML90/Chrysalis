Chrysalis is an open-source .NET library designed to facilitate the serialization and deserialization of Cardano blockchain data structures. With a strong focus on adhering to the Cardano standards and enhancing the .NET Cardano developer ecosystem, Chrysalis aims to provide developers with a reliable and consistent toolkit for working with Cardano.

ðŸš§ **NOTE:** This library is currently a work in progress. Feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Features

- **Cardano Serialization**: Convert Cardano blockchain data structures to and from CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation), allowing seamless and efficient data exchanges.
- **Bech32 Address Encoding/Decoding**: Simplifies the encoding and decoding of Cardano addresses, ensuring compatibility with widely used formats.This allows you to handle Cardano addresses seamlessly.
- **Extensive Data Model Support**: Work with a wide range of Cardano data types, including Transactions, Assets, MultiAssets, and more.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Interact with Cardano smart contracts.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Use Chrysalis in any .NET project, including .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin, and more.


## Roadmap ðŸš€

1. **(De)serialization Support**: Achieve complete serialization and deserialization for any Cardano data type described in CDDL https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/blob/master/eras/alonzo/test-suite/cddl-files/alonzo.cddl.
2. **Transaction Handling**: Introduce capabilities for building and signing Cardano transactions.
3. **Advanced Address Management**: Implement address generation, derivation, and other associated functionalities.

## Getting Started

To use Chrysalis in your .NET project:

1. You can install Chrysalis via NuGet:
    `dotnet add package Chrysalis`

2. Example Usage
    
    CBOR (De)serialization
    ```csharp
    var originalTransaction = CborSerializer.FromHex<Transaction>(originalTransactionCborHex)!;

    var serializedTransaction = CborSerializer.Serialize(originalTransaction);

    var deserializedTransaction = CborSerializer.Deserialize<Transaction>(serializedTransaction);
    ```

    Block Deserialization and Serialization
    ```csharp
        byte[] serializedBlock = CborSerializer.Serialize(originalBlock);
        Chrysalis.Cardano.Models.Core.Block.Block deserializedBlock = CborSerializer.Deserialize(serializedBlock);
    ```

    Access Deserialized Transactions, Transaction Inputs, and Transaction Outputs from a Deserialized Block
    ```csharp
        IEnumerable<TransactionBody> transactions = originalBlock.TransactionBodies();
        foreach (TransactionBody tx in transactions)
        {
            IEnumerable<TransactionInput> inputs = tx.Inputs();
            IEnumerable<TransactionOutput> outputs = tx.Outputs();    
        }
    ```

    Access a Transaction Input's Transaction Id and Index
    ```csharp
        foreach (TransactionInput input in tx.Inputs())
        {
            string id = input.TransacationId();
            ulong index = input.Index();
        }
    ```

    Access a Transaction Output's Address and Balance
    ```csharp
        foreach (TransactionOutput output in tx.Outputs())
        {
            string addr = output.Address().Value.ToBech32();
            Value balance = output.Amount();
            Value multiasset = balance.MultiAsset();
            ulong lovelace = balance.LoveLace();
        }
    ```

    Serialize Transactions in a Block
    ```csharp
        for (uint x = 0; x < transactions.Count(); x++)
        {
            CborSerializer.Serialize(transactions.ElementAt((int)x))
        }
    ```

    Bech32 Address Encoding/Decoding
    ```csharp
    var addressBech32 = "addr...";
    var addressObject = Address.FromBech32(addressBech32);
    var addressBech32Again = addressObject.ToBech32();
    var paymentKeyHash = addressObject.GetPaymentKeyHash();
    var stakeKeyHash = addressObject.GetStakeKeyHash();
    ```
